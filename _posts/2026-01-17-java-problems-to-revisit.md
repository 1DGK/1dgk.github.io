[Exercise 3 — Average and Standard Deviation of N Numbers](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/javaLessons/chap20/progExercises20.html)

This exercise involves reading a series of numbers from the user, calculating their average and standard deviation, and then displaying the results. It's a good opportunity to practice using arrays, loops, and mathematical functions in Java.

[Exercise 2 — Adding up Squares and Cubes](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/javaLessons/chap21/progExercises21.html)

[src/chapter04/conditionalsandloops/kjellexamples/AddingUpSquaresAndCubes.java](https://github.com/1DGK/JavaTests/blob/99b20628620e967d36016e66560a610be95f00b4/src/chapter04/conditionalsandloops/kjellexamples/AddingUpSquaresAndCubes.java)

This exercise requires writing a program that calculates the sum of squares and cubes of a series of numbers. It helps reinforce concepts related to loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations in Java.
