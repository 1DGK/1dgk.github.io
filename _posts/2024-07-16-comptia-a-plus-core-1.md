title: CNTP - Professor Messer A+ Training Course Core 1
---
This section of the Cyber Ninja Training Plan is a course that explains the material for the first half of the CompTIA A+ certification exam.

There is plenty of good material available for the exam, but Professor Messer offers high-quality training, freely available.

Check the [CompTIA A+ page](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) to make sure the newest version of the A+ exam matches with the videos by Professor Messer. CompTIA exams are usually every three years, and the most recent A+ exam came out in April 2022.

It took me about two weeks to get through the videos, then I took another week to do practice tests. I found a [study bundle published by Sybex for about $90 CAD](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1119863228?ref=emc_s_m_5_i_atc), which includes a bunch of practice tests. Moving forward, I'll take a day to test myself after I complete each study section.

- IP addressing
    - IPv4 is the primary protocol for almost everything we do
    - IPv6 is now part of all major operating systems
        - And the backbone of our internet infrastructure
- IPv4 addresses
    - OSI Layer 3 address
    - 32 bits - 4 bytes
    - Max decimal value for each byte is 255
- IPv6 addresses
    - 128-bit address
    - Crazy amount of options
    - Uses hex numbers
    - DNS is very important
- Networking with IPv4
    - IP Address
        - Every device needs a unique IP address
    - Subnet mask
        - Used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on
            - You'll ask for the subnet mask all the time
    - Default gateway
        - The router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet
- DNS servers
    - We remember names
    - Internet routers don't know names
        - Routers only know IP addresses
    - Something has to translate between names and IP addresses
        - DNS does it
    - You configure **two** DNS servers
        - That's how important it is

### 2.5 - Assigning IP Addresses
- DHCP
    - IPv4 addess config used to be manual
    - 1993 - bootstrap protocol BOOTP
        - Didn't auto assign everything
    - DCHP does it automatically
- DHCP process
    - DORA
        - A four-step process
            - Discover
                - Find a DHCP server
            - Offer
                - Get an offer
            - Request
                - Lock in the offer
            - Acknowledge
                - DHCP server confirmation
- Turning dynamic into static
    - DHCP assigns an IP from the first available 
        - Your IP will occasionally change
    - You may not want your IP to change
    - Disable DHCP on the device
        - Configure the IP info manually
        - Requires additional admin
    - Better Configure an IP reservation on the DHCP server
        - Associate a specific MAC address with an IP address
- Avoid manual configs
    - No DHCP server reservation
    - Difficult to change later
    - A DHCP reservation is preferable
- Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
    - A link-local address
    - IETF has reserved 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255

        - Useful public info
    - Can be used for verification purposes
    - Commonly used for email security

- DHCP address allocation
    - Address reservation
    - Table of MAC address
        - Each MAC address has a matching IP address
