## Hacking

I just learned about this game as well:

## Math Refresher
I'll start with this [assessment from Athabasca](https://www.athabascau.ca/math-site/math-diagnostic-assessment.html)

U Waterloo has [resources for high school math](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/resources/courseware?field_subject_area_tools_target_id=3). I'm mainly interested in the 9/10/11 Math Courseware. 

[This reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/5nk3ze/comment/dcc8d1m/) cleanly lays out a math progression.

[OSSU Math Prerequisites](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites)

Stanford [Intro to Mathematical Thinking](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/hstar-y0001-introduction-mathematical-thinking)
- [Adding It Up](http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9822)

MHF4U - [Nelson Advanced Functions 12](https://teachers.wrdsb.ca/ruhnke/files/2017/09/Nelson-Advanced-Functions-12-Textbook.pdf)

MCV4U - [Nelson 12 Calculus](http://mrkennedy.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/91710504/Nelson%20MCV4U%20Textbook.pdf)

U Waterloo - [Applied Math program](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/applied-mathematics). See first-year courses. First prereq is MCV4U or [MDM4U](https://tvolearn.com/products/mdm4u-mathematics-of-data-management-online-course)
- [Applied Math program outline](https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/courses?group=Applied%20Mathematics%20(AMATH)), from 2nd year onwards

And of course there's always Khan Academy, which should probably first on this list.

## Start with
[https://courseware.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/8](Advanced Functions MHF4U)

MHF4U -> MCV4U -> [Core Math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#core-math)

UofT [Calculus assessment](https://users.math.utoronto.ca/preparing-for-calculus/) for aspiring first-year university students.
