Also, I just found this interactive ['Introduction to Programming with Java' textbook from Runestone Academy](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csjava/index.html) that looks promising.

This is another course from Runestone Academy, which is tailored to AP CS students but is still useful for general Java learning: [CSAwesome2](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome2/csawesome2.html). The chapter related to this module is [Class Creation](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome2/unit3.html).

Also found this online Java sandbox: [CodeHS Java Sandbox](https://codehs.com/sandbox/java)

To create UML diagrams, you can use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) which is a free online tool.

**Working on**
EX 5.12 Write a method called sum100 that returns the sum of the integers
from 1 to 100, inclusive.
