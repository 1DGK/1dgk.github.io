Read the chapter.

Did the PowerPoint Slides.

Did the Self-Review Questions.

Followed the VideoNotes.

Installed IntelliJ IDEA and uninstalled all the Java extensions in VSCode.

Created a repo for textbook examples. Then I can practice them from anywhere. Just need to install IntelliJ and sync Github account. Then clone the [JavaTests repo](https://github.com/1DGK/JavaTests).

Working on getting the Github Student Developer pack. It's an automated system that only takes photos taken from a camera, so it's a PITA.

Got back on the Helsinki Java MOOC. Installed TMCBeans. I'm on Part 1 -> Calculating with numbers -> **Simple calculator**

Currently on Kjell Part 4: Branches and Loops, chapters 16-25.

Now I'm using TMCBeans for the Helsinki Java MOOC, VSCode for my website, and Intellij IDEA for the TRU course.

Currently working on Exercises for Chapter 16 of Kjell course. Pump the brakes on the MOOC.

Now I'm starting Chapter 17, The Single Branch if Statement
