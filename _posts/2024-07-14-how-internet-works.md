### My Notes
Based off ARPANET

Distributed packet-switched network.

Think of the postal service. But the internet ships binary information. On or off, yes or no, 1 or 0. 

The atoms of information. 

Electricity, light, and radio waves.

Bandwidth is the maximum transmission capacity of a device. Measured by bit rate. 

Latency is the time it takes for a bit to get from one place to another. 

2008 Submarine Cable Disruption.

The Internet is really a design philosophy that uses protocols. 

IP's and DNS.

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol. Like a guaranteed mail service.

SSL and TLS. Like a layer of security. 

256-bit encryption is really good for the time being. 

Public key cryptography.

Cyber crime is bad.

Search engines. Spider bots. Google created Page Rank.
