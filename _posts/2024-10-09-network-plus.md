This section of the Cyber Ninja Training Plan is a course that explains the material for the CompTIA Network+ certification exam.

There is plenty of good material available for the exam, but Professor Messer offers high-quality training for free.

Check the [CompTIA Network+ page](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) to make sure the newest version of the Network+ exam matches with the videos by Professor Messer. CompTIA exams are usually every three years, and the most recent Network+ exam came out in June 2024.
