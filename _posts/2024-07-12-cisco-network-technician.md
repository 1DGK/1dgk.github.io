# Cisco Networking Academy - Network Technician Path
This is a free resource that currently has two free career paths: Junior Cybersecurity Analyst and Network Technician. Following are my notes for the latter.

## Networking Basics
**Types of networks**: small home / office, medium to large networks, the internet - network of networks. 

**Data transmission**: electrical, optical, wireless. 

The capacity of the medium to carry data is known as **bandwidth**.

Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that can be sent across the media in a second.

**Clients and Servers**: all connected computers are classified as hosts, if they participate directly in network communication. 

Servers are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide information to other hosts in the network. 

Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the hosts to request and display the information from the server.

**Network Components**: end devices (computers, phones, etc.), intermediate devices, network media.

**ISP Connectivity Options**: the average user is unaware of the backbone of the internet, e.g. the fiber-optic cables that cross the globe. Fiber typically doesn't go into the home. It's cable or DSL. There's also cellular, satellite, and dial-up telephone.

**Wireless Networks**: GSM, 4G / 5G, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC

**Wireless Device Connectivity**: Wi-Fi radios use less power than cellular radios, so Wi-Fi networks conserve battery power.

**Home Networking Basics**: Ethernet ports (usually labelled "Ethernet" or "LAN"), and internet port (which connects the router to a different network than the Ethernet ports, like the Internet).

**Network Technologies in the Home**: 2.4- 2.48GHz and 5.725-5.85Ghz. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Powerline.

**Wireless Standards**:

**Set Up a Home Router**:
