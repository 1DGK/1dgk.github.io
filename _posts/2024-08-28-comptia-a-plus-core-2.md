title: CNTP - Professor Messer A+ Training Course Core 2
---
This section of the Cyber Ninja Training Plan is a course that explains the material for the second half of the CompTIA A+ certification exam.

There is plenty of good material available for the exam, but Professor Messer offers high-quality training for free.

Check the [CompTIA A+ page](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) to make sure the newest version of the A+ exam matches with the videos by Professor Messer. CompTIA exams are usually every three years, and the most recent A+ exam came out in April 2022.

It took me about two weeks to get through the videos, then I took another week to do practice tests. I found a [study bundle published by Sybex for about $90 CAD](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1119863228?ref=emc_s_m_5_i_atc), which includes a bunch of practice tests. Moving forward, I'll take a day to test myself after I complete each study section.
