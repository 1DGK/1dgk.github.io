### My Notes
Common to all computers: Input - Store - Process - Output

Input: converts physical input to binary information.

Adafruit Technologies

Microsoft Hack for Good

Signal is either ON or OFF. That's a bit, 1 or 0. 

Any number can be represented with binary, i.e., wires that are either on or off. The more wires you use, the larger the numbers you can store.

Text (ASCII), video/images (RGB), and sound (sampling) in binary.

Circuits. Logic. AND, NOT, etc.

The smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal needs to travel.

Electricity moves at just about the speed of light, so modern circuits can perform billions of calculations per second.
