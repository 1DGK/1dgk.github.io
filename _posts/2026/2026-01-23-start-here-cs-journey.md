I'm learning Computer Science through an online degree and consistent practice. This site is my notebook of coursework, projects, and certifications.

- Begin with the **[Journey](/journey/)** hub for curated milestones.
- Browse current **[Projects](/projects/)** and my **[GitHub](https://github.com/1dgk)**.
- Use **[Resources](/resources/)**, **[Categories](/categories/)** and **[Tags](/tags/)** to explore notes by topic.

Thanks for visiting — feedback and tips are welcome.
