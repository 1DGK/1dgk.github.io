title: CNTP - Learn Regular Expressions in 20 Minutes
---
In this section of the Cyber Ninja Training Plan is a quick course that explains the basics of regular expressions. Regex is a rabbit hole, and there's no way to become close to an expert in 20 minutes, but this is simply to get familiar with the subject.  

Here is a link to the [Cyber Ninja Training Plan](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvDXyd4cgfxegZRq8OELn7MEbxtkkg?e=Ocfhvq). 

Here is a link to the video by Web Dev Simplified, [Learn Regular Expressions in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk).

### My Notes
[RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - an online tool to learn, build and test Regular Expressions.

A way to search through a string of text. In an advanced way.

A ton of things you can do with regex.

Surrounded by forward slashes. 

Flags go after the last forward slash. E.g. `/cat/g`

/ea+/g

/.at/g

/\./g

/\w/g

/\s/g

/\w{4,5}/g

/{fc}at/g

/(t|T)he/g

/^The/g

To be honest, just use the explainer website regexr, linked above.

Positive look-behind.

Look-ahead.
