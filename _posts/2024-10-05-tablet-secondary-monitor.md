title: How to Use an Android Tablet as a Secondary Monitor with spacedesk
---
I have a laptop and a tablet, and I want to use the tablet as a secondary monitor.

The laptop will be the server and the tablet will be the client.

On the laptop/server, download and install the driver version of spacedesk.

On the tablet, install the viewer version of spacedesk.

Open the spacedesk driver console (find it with a right-click of the toolbar icon). Under Communication Interfaces, check USB Cable Android and uncheck Local Area Network. This forces the application to run the second monitor through the attached cable.

Connect the tablet to the laptop and open spacedesk on both devices. Bob's your uncle. 

Reminder:
- Laptop = server = driver software
- Tablet = client = viewer software
