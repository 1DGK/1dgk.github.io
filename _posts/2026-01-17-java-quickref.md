I want to make my own quick reference for Java programming. Here are some useful links I've found so far:

[Intro CS at Princeton](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/)

[Java Cheat Sheet by OverAPI](https://overapi.com/java)

[Java Quick Reference by TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_quick_guide.htm)
