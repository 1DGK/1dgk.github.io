# Workouts

Here is a comprehensive 12-week program designed to bridge the gap between your marathon background, your aesthetic goals, and the specific demands of the PLQ course.

**Important Note:** Listen to your body. At 37, with the added impact of rucking, recovery is your limiting factor. If you feel sharp pain (joints), rest. If you feel fatigue (muscles), push through.

---

### Key Tips for Success

1.  **Boots:** Wear the boots you will use on the course for *all* rucking sessions starting in Phase 1. Do not ruck in running shoes; the mechanics are different.
2.  **Socks & Care:** Use merino wool socks. If you feel a "hot spot" (pre-blister) on your feet during a ruck, stop and adjust immediately.
3.  **Hydration:** Start hydrating the night before a heavy ruck, not just during it.
4.  **The "Marathon Hangover":** As a former runner, your instinct will be to go fast. **Resist this.** Rucking speed comes from a powerful stride and glute engagement, not shuffling feet. Stand tall.

This schedule maximizes your muscle growth (Aesthetic goal) while ensuring you show up to PLQ fit, strong, and durable enough to lead. Good luck, future MCpl!

# Overall Roadmap

This changes the strategy significantly. Congratulations on the marathon—that gives you a massive aerobic advantage. However, shifting from marathon endurance to military fitness requires a pivot in training philosophy.

The Primary Leadership Qualification (PLQ) is not just about passing a fitness test; it is about **durability under load**. You will be wearing a rucksack, carrying equipment, and operating on little sleep. At 37, your joints need to be prepared for this impact.

Here is how we merge your "Aesthetic/Build" goal with the specific demands of the Canadian Armed Forces PLQ course.

### The Strategy: "Tactical Hypertrophy"

You want to look good (aesthetics), but for the military, you need "armor." We aren't just building show muscles; we are building **structural integrity**.
*   **Neck & Traps:** Essential for helmet/kit comfort.
*   **Lower Back & Core:** Vital for rucking and carrying casualties.
*   **Legs & Glutes:** The engine for loaded movement.

**The Danger Zone:** Your marathon past means your default engine is "slow and steady." The PLQ requires "fast and heavy." We need to convert some of that slow-twitch endurance into explosive power.

---

### The 12-Week Roadmap (3 Months)

**Phase 1: The Foundation (Weeks 1–4)**
*   **Focus:** Rebuilding strength and introducing load bearing.
*   **Goal:** Correct muscle imbalances from running and get your body used to weightlifting again.
*   **Training:**
    *   **Strength (3x/week):** Full body compound lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Bench, Overhead Press). Focus on perfect form, not max weight yet.
    *   **Rucking (1x/week):** Start with 20lbs in a backpack. Walk 5km at a brisk pace. *Do not run with the weight yet.*
    *   **Cardio:** Switch from long runs to intervals (sprints) to build power.

**Phase 2: The Build & Load (Weeks 5–8)**
*   **Focus:** Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth) and Rucking Endurance.
*   **Goal:** Add muscle mass (aesthetic goal) and increase ruck weight.
*   **Training:**
    *   **Strength (4x/week):** Split routine (Upper/Lower). Use rep ranges of 8–12 to stimulate muscle growth.
    *   **Rucking (2x/week):** Increase weight to 35–40lbs (standard fighting load). Distance: 5–8km. Focus on posture.
    *   **Calisthenics:** Start doing push-ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups frequently. The PLQ involves a lot of bodyweight exercises.

**Phase 3: The Peak (Weeks 9–12)**
*   **Focus:** Specificity and FORCE Test Preparation.
*   **Goal:** Peak performance for the specific test elements.
*   **Training:**
    *   **Strength (2x/week):** Maintain strength. Focus on high-intensity circuits (Circuit training with weights).
    *   **FORCE Test Simulation:** Practice the specific tests (Sandbag lift, Sandbag drag, Shuttles).
    *   **Rucking (2x/week):** One heavy ruck (50lbs for 5km) and one fast ruck (35lbs for fast pace).

### The "FORCE" Test Specifics
The CAF uses the FORCE Evaluation. You must pass these 4 elements. Since you want to excel, train specifically for them now:

1.  **20m Rushes (Shuttles):** You have the lungs from the marathon, but do you have the lateral agility? Practice 20m sprints with abrupt stops and starts.
2.  **Sandbag Lift:** Lifting a 20kg sandbag from ground to shoulder.
    *   *Training:* Practice "Deadlift to High Pull" movements. This builds the traps and shoulders (aesthetic benefit) while prepping for the test.
3.  **Intermittent Loaded Shuttles:** Carrying 20kg bags.
    *   *Training:* **Farmer’s Carries.** Carry heavy dumbbells (30kg+) for distance. This builds massive forearm/grip strength and thickens the upper back/traps (high aesthetic value).
4.  **Sandbag Drag:** Dragging 20kg backwards.
    *   *Training:* Heavy sled pulls or backward drags in the gym.

---

### Nutrition for the "Aesthetic" Goal
Since you have a marathon background, you might be used to carb-loading. For muscle building, we need to shift focus.
*   **Protein is King:** You need to repair the damage from lifting and rucking. Aim for **160g of protein daily**.
*   **Calories:** Eat at a **slight surplus** (approx. 2,800–3,000 calories). You need the energy to fuel the rucking. Do not try to diet (cut calories) during PLQ prep; you need the fuel.
*   **Hydration:** Practice drinking water while moving. Dehydration is the #1 cause of failure on course.

### A "Gotcha" for the 37-Year-Old Body
*   **Foot Care:** You know this from marathons, but rucking is different. It destroys feet differently than running. Buy boots *now* (Bates, Magnum, or issued boots) and break them in during Phase 1. Do not show up with new boots.
*   **Shin Splints:** Going from running to rucking often causes shin splints. Ice your shins after ruck marches and strengthen your tibialis (front shin muscle) by walking on your heels.

### Summary of Your Goals
1.  **Aesthetic Goal:** Gain 2–3kg of upper body muscle (shoulders/back) to fill out the uniform.
2.  **Performance Goal:** Complete the FORCE Test in the "Exempt" or "Outstanding" category.
3.  **Tactical Goal:** Complete a 10km ruck with 50lbs in under 2 hours comfortably before the course starts.

Does this timeline sound manageable with your current work/life schedule? I can provide a specific weekly workout schedule if you need one.

# No Gym Days
The good news is that military fitness is historically built on "calisthenics and grit," so missing a gym day is not a problem. In fact, training without equipment is often more specific to the PLQ course environment.

Since you have a rucksack, **you have a gym**. A loaded rucksack is one of the best tools for muscle building when you don't have weights.

Here is how to substitute the "Gym Days" from the previous plan with "Field/Home Workouts."

### The "No-Gym" Substitution Rules

*   **Squats/Deadlifts** -> **Ruck Squats & Lunges.** Wearing your ruck turns bodyweight moves into heavy lifts.
*   **Bench Press** -> **Weighted Push-ups.** Put your ruck on your back (or have a partner place it) while doing push-ups. It mimics the bench press mechanics.
*   **Pull-ups** -> **Find a Beam.** If you don't have a pull-up bar, find a park, a sturdy tree branch, or a playground. If absolutely nothing is available, do "Doorframe Rows" (grabbing the side of a doorframe and pulling yourself toward it).
*   **Weights** -> **Ruck as a Kettlebell.** You can hold the handle of your rucksack to do curls, overhead presses, and rows.

### Modified Schedule for "No-Gym" Days

Here is how you adapt the specific gym sessions I gave you.

#### Phase 1 Adjustments

**Monday (Strength) -> "The Ruck Circuit"**
*   **Ruck Squats:** Wear the ruck (20-25lbs). 3 sets of 15 reps. (Slow and controlled).
*   **Weighted Push-ups:** Ruck on back. 3 sets to failure.
*   **Lunges:** Wearing the ruck. 3 sets of 12 per leg.
*   **Plank:** Standard.

**Thursday (Strength) -> "Functional Bodyweight"**
*   **Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (RDL):** No weight needed initially, hold the ruck in your hands for a challenge. 3 sets of 10 per leg. *Crucial for ankle/knee stability.*
*   **Pike Push-ups:** Hands and feet on the floor, hips high (like a Downward Dog yoga pose). Lower head to floor and push up. 3 sets of 10. *This builds shoulder strength without weights.*
*   **Pull-ups:** Find a branch or bar. 3 sets to failure.
*   **Step-ups:** Use a sturdy chair, stairs, or a park bench. Step up with the ruck on your back.

---

#### Phase 2 Adjustments

**Monday (Upper Body) -> "The Pump"**
*   **Diamond Push-ups:** (Hands close together). 4 sets to failure. *Targets Triceps and inner chest.*
*   **Doorframe Rows or Bodyweight Rows:** (Lie under a sturdy table, grab the edge, pull chest to table). 4 sets of 12.
*   **Pike Push-ups:** 3 sets of 12.
*   **Ruck Curls:** Hold the ruck handle with both hands (or use sandbags/rocks). Curl it up. 3 sets of 15.
*   **Lateral Raises:** Hold water bottles or small rocks in each hand. Raise arms to side. 3 sets of 15.

**Wednesday (Lower Body) -> "Leg Day"**
*   **Bulgarian Split Squats:** One foot on a chair/couch behind you. Do these with your ruck on. 3 sets of 10 per leg. *This is the single best leg exercise for military fitness.*
*   **Single-Leg RDL:** Hold the ruck in your hands. 3 sets of 10.
*   **Calf Raises:** Do these on a step edge with the ruck on. 3 sets of 20.

**Friday (Upper Body) -> "Beach Muscles & Endurance"**
*   **Tricep Dips:** Use a chair, couch edge, or park bench. 3 sets of 15.
*   **Push-up Variations:** Do 3 rounds of: 10 Wide-grip push-ups, 10 Standard, 10 Diamond. No rest in between.
*   **Ruck Overhead Press:** Lift your ruck from the ground to overhead (clean and press). 3 sets of 10.

---

#### Phase 3 Adjustments

**Monday (Maintenance) -> "The Standard"**
*   **Push-ups:** 3 sets of max reps (Passing standard for the FORCE test involves speed, so try to do these fast).
*   **Air Squats:** 3 sets of 30 reps. (High volume to keep legs conditioned).
*   **Burpees:** 3 sets of 15. (The ultimate military conditioning tool).
*   **Farmer’s Carry:** Pick up two heavy objects (water jugs, rocks, or the ruck itself) and walk for 100 meters.

**Thursday (Heavy Ruck)**
*   This is already a "no gym" workout. Stick to the plan: 5km Fast Ruck with 50lbs.

**Friday (Circuit)**
*   This is already bodyweight. Stick to the plan: Push-ups, Squats, Pull-ups, Burpees.

---

### Pro-Tips for the "No-Gym" Days

1.  **Time Under Tension:** Without heavy weights, you need to make the "lighter" weight feel heavier.
    *   *Example:* When doing a Ruck Squat, take 3 seconds to go down, hold for 1 second at the bottom, and explode up. This tears muscle fiber effectively for growth.
2.  **Improvised Weights:** If your ruck isn't heavy enough for legs, find a sandbag, a large rock, or even a full water jug (approx 20-25kg when full).
3.  **Grip Strength:** When carrying your ruck by the handle (suitcase carry), your grip will fail before your legs do. This is excellent for the Sandbag Drag portion of the FORCE test.

By using these substitutions, you won't lose any progress. In fact, the instability of the ruck will recruit more stabilizer muscles, making you more resilient for the course.
