- Reading **The Director** by Daniel Kehlmann (2023). It's about how the filmmaker Pabst came back to Nazi Germany and made films under the regime. Fascinating look at art under authoritarianism.

- Watching **Marty Supreme**. Watched Conan's interview with Josh Safdie. Heard there was some controversy with Safdie and an underaged actress, but the evidence seems inconclusive. It was evident that each film he makes takes over his life for years.
