Finished **The Director**. Started **The Sound and the Fury** by William Faulkner (1929).

For COMP 1131, I'm almost finished Assignment 4, which involves creating classes. One is a 'Domino' class to represent domino tiles, and the other is a 'Monkey' class to simulate a monkey climbing in the jungle.
